# google-maps-services-rust
A Rust binding library for Google Maps Web Services. I can't find one that exists so I'm going to start building one myself. Pull requests are more than welcome.

Work in progress and in the pipeline for this project can be found [here](https://tree.taiga.io/project/backend_dev-google-web-services-rust/kanban "Kanban for google-web-services-rust")

## Plans
The aim is to have a production grade API binding library with unit and integration tests and Travis CI integration.

## Current status
This is being built in my spare time, so progress might be a bit erratic. This will be updated as time goes.
