# Semver Guidelines

Prior to the 1.0 release, the following standards shall be followed for semver:


## For 0.0.1:
* Bugfixes
* New optional endpoint added for an endpoint


## For 0.1:
* All required fields implemented for an endpoint

The process towards 1.0 shall be set once all the endpoints have been implemented.


More to be progressively added.
