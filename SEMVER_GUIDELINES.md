# Semver Guidelines

Prior to the 1.0 release, the following standards shall be followed for semver:


## For 0.x.y:
* Bugfixes
* New optional endpoint added for an endpoint
* Breaking changes prior to 0.1.0


## For 0.x:
* All required fields implemented for an endpoint
* Breaking API changes permitted

The process towards 1.0.0 shall be set once all the endpoints have been implemented.
